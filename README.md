# Survived 1 Year Prediction

## Problem Statement
A hospital in the province of Greenland has been trying to improve its care conditions by looking at historic survival of the patients. They tried looking at their data but could not identify the main factors leading to high survivals.

## Object

Our object was to develop a [model](https://github.com/AndreasAvgou/Survived-1-Year-Prediction/blob/main/Survived_1_year.ipynb) that will predict the chances of survival of a patient after 1 year of treatment (Survived_1_year).

## Dataset 

You can find the train set in this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dphi-official/Datasets/master/pharma_data/Training_set_begs.csv) and the test set in this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dphi-official/Datasets/master/pharma_data/Testing_set_begs.csv)
